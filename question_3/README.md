# Electrolux knowledge assessment - Question 3

> Implement a function able to calculate and return the average, maximum and minimum value of an array with “n” positions. This function must also return a copy of the input array containing only the even numbers of the original array, as well as the new array size. Implement this logic using the C language and share this code through a public repository on GitHub.

## Resolution

Resolution is written on `main.c` file.

## Build instructions with gcc

```bash
gcc main.c array_calculator.c
```
